# Regression in ML

Regression is a fundamental supervised learning technique in machine learning used to model and analyze the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (features). The goal of regression is to predict a continuous output value based on input data.

## Key Points

- **Types:** Linear regression, ridge regression, and lasso regression.
- **Purpose:** Predicting numerical values, like the price of a piece of land.
- **How it Works:** Learns from historical data to find the best-fit function that maps inputs to outputs.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Root Mean Squared Error (EMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared (RÂ²).

## Applications

- Forecasting sales or stock prices
- Estimating real estate values
- Predicting risk in finance and insurance
- Modeling physical phenomena in science and engineering

Regression is a core concept in machine learning, forming the basis for many real-world predictive analytics tasks.
