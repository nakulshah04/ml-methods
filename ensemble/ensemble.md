**Ensembling in Machine Learning**

Ensembling is a powerful approach in machine learning where multiple models are combined to produce a single, more accurate prediction. The main idea is that by aggregating the strengths of different models, the ensemble can outperform any individual model, leading to improved accuracy, reduced variance, and better generalization to new data.

There are several popular ensembling techniques:

- **Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating):** Trains multiple versions of a model on different random subsets of the data and averages their predictions to reduce variance.
- **Boosting:** Sequentially trains models, each focusing on correcting the errors of the previous ones, and combines their outputs to improve overall performance.
- **Stacking:** Combines predictions from several base models using a meta-model, which learns how best to integrate their outputs.

Ensembling is widely used in machine learning competitions and real-world applications to achieve state-of-the-art results.
