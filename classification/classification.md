# Classification in Machine Learning

Classification is a supervised learning technique in machine learning used to assign input data into predefined categories or classes. The goal of classification is to predict a discrete label or class for a given input based on learned patterns from labeled data.

## Key Points

- **Types:** Binary, multiclass, and multilabel classification (multiple labels per instance).
- **Purpose:** Predicting categorical outcomes, such as spam vs. not spam, or disease vs. no disease.
- **How it Works:** The model learns from labeled training data to distinguish between different classes and assigns the most probable class to new, unseen data.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

## Applications

- Email spam detection
- Image recognition (e.g., identifying objects in photos)
- Medical diagnosis (e.g., classifying diseases)
- Sentiment analysis (e.g., positive or negative reviews)

Classification is widely used in machine learning for tasks where the output is a category or class label.
